## About the Collection

This collection is a gathering of thirty digitzed photographs that I personally took in Florida and France at their respective Disney theme parks; Walt Disney World and Disneyland Paris, in 2024 and 2023 respectively. The images are jpeg format, and have been downloded from my own personal device.

Walt Disney World is located 20 miles southwest of Orlando, Florida, and was first opened in 1971. The theme park resort contains up to 19 resort hotels, four parks, two water parks, and other recreational facilities toaccomodate guests. The park was first proposed and designed by Walt Disney after the opening of Disneyland in Anaheim, California in 1955. Originally known as "The Florida Project", Disney World began construction in 1967, a year after the death of Walt Disney in 1966. Walt's brother, Roy Disney, changed the park's name to Walt Disney World to honor his brother. Walt Disney World has become a globally renowned and popular vacation resort and is considered a staple of American popular culture. The four different parks are Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, EPCOT, and Hollywood Studios, with the water parks being Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon. The resort hosts several annual events each year. The park is also recently changing, with the addition of new areas such as Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, in Hollywood Studios, and the replacing of Dinoland U.S.A. with a new South America themed area in Animal Kingdom.

Disneyland Paris is located 32 kilometers east of Paris, France, in Europe. The resort includes two theme parks, Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park, seven disney-owned hotels, and other shopping, dining, and entertainment facilities. The resort first opened in 1992, and has become one of the most visited theme parks in Europe. Following the success of Tokyo Disneyland in 1983, the Wlat Disney Company began seeking out potential sites for another theme park and eventually selected a site in France. The Walt Disney Company signed the agreement with the French government for the site in 1985, and construction began in 1988. The park was originally named Euro Disneyland, but the name was changed to Disneyland Paris in 1994. Disneyland Paris is noted for its environmental sustainability, with programs for recycling and water management, and the use of solar panels to help reduce greenhouse gases.

The purpose of this collection is to provide information to people who are looking for possible sites to travel to with friends or family, or are looking for information about the Disney Parks themselves, or reasearching the history of Walt Disney and his Company and Disney-related sites. I had the opportunity to take these photographs on my personal phone during a family trip to Disneyland Paris in the month of June in 2023, and then during a personal trip with my mother to Walt Disney World in May of 2024.
